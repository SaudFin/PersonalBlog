# Personal Blog

This project is the first one of FEND-Udacity projects, and it is purely HTML and CSS.

## My approach to the project

I divided the project into four versions, and each one had one feature or more added to it.

```
 Version 1:-
    1- structure the homepage HTML document in three parts (Nav, Blog Post Cards Area, footer)
    2- Use CSS Grid to display the structure on the screen
    3- Create the HTML elements for the blog post cards, and display them properly
    4- Use CSS to do basic styling
    5- review all the steps and fix any bugs if there is any
 Version 2:-
    1- link the button in the blog post cards to the blogPost HTML document
    2- add a link at the top to return to the homepage
    3- create an <h1> element to display the title of the post
    4- create a <div> element for the author details, and leave it empty for v3.
    5- create an element and loreipsum content for post
    6- create social sharing links
 Version 3:-
    1- create the elements that are needed for the the author info in the empty <div>
    2- Use CSS flex to display it according to the sketch
    3- Start styling the project.
Version 4:-
    1- Make the website responsive for phone, tablet, and desktop
